## Ingredients
### Salting
2 heads of Napa Cabbages[^1]  
Plenty of coarse salt

### Seasoning
0.5 bowl of cooked rice[^2]  
0.5 apple  
3 red chili peppers  
2 Ts. minced ginger  
3 Ts. minced garlic  
1 onion  
100ml fish sauce[^3]  
1 cup Korean chili flakes[^4]  
2 Ts. sugar

## Instructions
1. Wash the cabbage and cut it into appropriate sizes.
2. In a large salad bowl, alternate layers of the cabbage and coarse salt.
3. Let it sit and brine for 2–3 hours.
4. Drain the moisture using a strainer.
5. Mix well with the seasoning ingredients.
6. Store in the refrigerator.

## Notes
It’s a bit spicy. I might use less chili powder next time. Also, reducing the rice and making the seasoning a bit more liquid could improve the texture.

[^1]: I used Chinakohl, which is easy to find at Edeka, Lidl, etc. The outer leaves are trimmed, and the size is much smaller than Korean kimchi cabbage.
[^2]: Instead of Korean or sushi rice, I used jasmine rice, which I usually eat.
[^3]: I mixed Korean tuna sauce (참치액) and Thai fish sauce, both available at Korean grocery stores or Go Asia.
[^4]: In Berlin, Ourhome kimchi chili powder is always stocked on the shelves.
